# Image Plagiarism Detection

## What is Plagiarism
Plagiarism is an act of stealing someone elseâ€™s work and admitting and passing them off as one's own, and now we have a system to detect this act.
From this document, the readers will get a clear and easy view of Image Plagiarism Detection System. 

## What does the python source code does ?
1. It inputs two images (.jpeg) which could be identified as Original Image and Doubtful Image. 
2. Then subtracts Doubtful Image from Original Image.
3. If any difference is not found out, then both the images are similar (or Plagiarized/copied)
4. Else the images are different. 
5. Then it detects whether the doubtful image has added something (new to the original image/morphed
an original image a little bit). 
6. After that, it prints out the Resultant difference image which shows what extra was added to the original image.

## Language and Software used :
1. Python
2. Pycharm IDE
