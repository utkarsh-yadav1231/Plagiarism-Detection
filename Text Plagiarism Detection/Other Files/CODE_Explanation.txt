# Program 1.0 Code Explanation

1) import difflib 
/* 
	The difflib module contains tools for computing and working with differences between sequences. 
	It is especially useful for comparing text, and includes functions that produce reports using 
	several common difference formats.
*/

2) from difflib import SequenceMatcher
/*
	The SequenceMatcher class compares two sequences of any types, as long as the values are hashable.
	It uses an algorithm to identify the longest contiguous matching blocks from the sequences,
	eliminating “junk” values that do not contribute to the real data.
*/

3) str(open(first_file).readlines())
/*
	Python file method readlines() reads until EOF using readline() and returns a list containing the lines.
*/

4) difflib.HtmlDiff().make_file()
/*
	The make_file() method produces a fully-formed HTML file as output.
*/

5)	d.make_table()
/*
	make_table(), which only returns the table tag containing the difference information.
*/

# Program 2.0 Code Explanation

1) str1=''.join(text1)
/*
	If you want to use a method for concatenation in python you can use: join
*/

2) str1.split('.')
/*  
	Python split string by.
	In this example, we are splitting the strings using the . followed by space. 
	Within the last statement, we removed the extra space.
